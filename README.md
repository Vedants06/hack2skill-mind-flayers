# Medicare: AI-Powered Healthcare Ecosystem 🏥

Medicare is an end-to-end healthcare platform designed to bridge the gap between complex medical data and patient understanding. By leveraging Generative AI, Medicare transforms jargon-heavy medical reports into actionable insights, automates medication tracking, and streamlines professional healthcare management.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **AI Medical Interpreter:** Uses Groq & Gemini AI to translate complex PDF lab reports and blood tests into plain, empathetic English.
- **Risk Assessment Dashboard:** Real-time analysis of health data to generate safety scores and visual health summaries.
- **SafeDose Management:** Automated medication scheduling with integrated **Google Calendar** synchronization.
- **Accessibility Suite:** Integrated **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** for voice-guided medical instructions.
- **Secure Auth:** Robust patient data protection powered by **Firebase Authentication**.

## 🚀 The Mission
We chose the healthcare domain because it is "data-rich but insight-poor." Medicare solves the "last mile" problem in healthcare—moving from passive record-keeping to an active, 24/7 AI health partner that democratizes medical knowledge and restores patient agency.
